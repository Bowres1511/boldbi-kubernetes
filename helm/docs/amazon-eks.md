# Bold BI on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

## Deployment prerequisites

1. Create an Amazon EKS cluster and [node group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-compute.html) to deploy Bold BI.

2. Connect to your Amazon EKS cluster.

3. Deploy the EFS CSI Driver to your cluster and create an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume to store the shared folders for applicationsâ€™ usage by following the below link.

   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html 

4. Note the **File system ID** after creating EFS file system.

```

_See [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation._

3. Configure your setting overrides

Just like any typical Helm chart, you'll need to craft a values.yaml file that would define/override any of the values exposed into the default values.yaml

_See [configuration](configuration.md) for more details._

### Install and run

```console
# Helm 3
helm upgrade --install --values my-values.yaml [RELEASE_NAME] boldbi/boldbi
```

_See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

## Uninstall Chart

```console
# Helm 3
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

## Upgrade Chart

```console
# Helm 3
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] boldbi/boldbi [flags]
```

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._
