## Deployment prerequisites

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to deploy Bold BI.

2. Create a File share instance in your storage account and note the File share name to store the shared folders for applicationsâ€™ usage.

3. Encode the storage account name and storage key in base64 format.

4. Connect with your Microsoft AKS cluster.

## Running

1. Add the Superset helm repository

```console
helm repo add boldbi https://boldbi.github.io/boldbi-kubernetes
helm repo update
```

2. View charts in repo

```console
helm search repo boldbi

```

_See [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation._

3. Configure your setting overrides

Just like any typical Helm chart, you'll need to craft a values.yaml file that would define/override any of the values exposed into the default values.yaml

_See [configuration](configuration.md) for more details._

### Install and run

```console
# Helm 3
helm upgrade --install --values my-values.yaml [RELEASE_NAME] boldbi/boldbi
```

_See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

## Uninstall Chart

```console
# Helm 3
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

## Upgrade Chart

```console
# Helm 3
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] boldbi/boldbi [flags]
```

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._
